# Stake Authorization

{% hint style="warning" %}
TACo is currently in the process of transitioning away from the [Threshold Network](https://threshold.network) to a new staking infrastructure. As a result, **no new TACo stakes or authorizations will be permitted until this transition is fully completed.**

During this period, existing TACo node operators are still required to maintain and run their nodes in order to continue receiving staking rewards. **The network’s functionality remains intact for current participants, but no additional stakes and new nodes can be added at this time.**

Once TACo’s updated staking infrastructure is fully operational, we will provide detailed instructions on how to stake and participate in the network moving forward.

For the latest updates and announcements regarding this transition, please stay connected via the [TACo Discord server](https://discord.gg/buildwithtaco).
