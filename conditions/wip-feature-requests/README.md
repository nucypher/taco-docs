# WIP / Feature Requests

This section showcases a range of enhancements in various stages of development for future TACo releases, ranging from early design to near completion. Any implemented features are available exclusively on the [`lynx` testnet](../../taco-integration/get-started-with-tac.md#testnet-domains).&#x20;

To use this functionality, ensure that you use the `devnet`tagged version of [`@nucypher/taco`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nucypher/taco?activeTab=versions). i.e.

```bash
$ npm install @nucypher/taco@devnet
```

We are actively seeking feedback on these innovative designs and features to gauge interest and prioritize future development. You can also submit requests for desired features.

Relevant improvements and feature requests can be submitted [here](https://github.com/nucypher/taco-web/issues).
