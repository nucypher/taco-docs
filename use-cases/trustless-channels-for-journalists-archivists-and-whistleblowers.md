# Trustless channels for journalists, archivists & whistleblowers

### Problem space

\*Journalists increasingly targeted with spyware\
\*Vulnerable to censorship (e.g. shadowbanning) by centralized platforms \
\*Evidence release needs complex conditionality&#x20;

### Value propositions enabled by TACo&#x20;

Location sharing \
Shared knowledge base\
Evidence timestamping, validation, archiving and future sharing \
Anonymous dropbox with custom access logic&#x20;

* Denial-of-service & censorship risk reduced significantly, providing a reliable insurance in the worst-case scenario.&#x20;
* Composable access condition logic to cover complex sharing scenarios.&#x20;
* End-to-end encrypted data sharing augments domain-specific applications with ancillary functions.&#x20;

### Integration framework

_Protocol schematic_\
Journalist Device <> TACo Nodes <> 3rd Party APIs (e.g. ProofMode) + EVM <> Qualifying Consumer

_Authentication_ \
_\*_&#x53;IWE for encryptors\
\*OAuth for decryptors&#x20;

_Advanced TACo features_  \
\*Off-chain conditions\
\*Encryption sig reuse\
\*Combination with TOR
