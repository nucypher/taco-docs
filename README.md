# Introduction to TACo

TACo (**T**hreshold **A**ccess **Co**ntrol) lets you share encrypted data securely - no central servers, no trusted intermediaries. Control who can decrypt your data, how, and when - all via a fully decentralized network.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All third-party services – digital, Web3 and beyond – impose a trust burden on the user. TACo minimizes this trust burden by disassembling and distributing sensitive cryptographic operations – key generation, access condition verification, and decryption fragment provision – across a large group of independently operated nodes. To understand TACo's trust model and read the _Mainnet_ _Trust Disclosure_, head to the [Trust Assumptions](for-product-leads/trust-assumptions/) section.&#x20;
