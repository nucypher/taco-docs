# Use Cases

### Community Bot-Assisted Transactions&#x20;

Community platforms (e.g. a Discord server) leverage TACo, account abstraction, and specialized bots for secure member-to-member transactions .&#x20;

* **Challenge**: User wants to tip another user without setting up their own wallet, nor trusting a Discord bot with unconstrained access to their funds.&#x20;
* **Solution**: Conditional signing that only allows transactions that meet specific criteria – amount limits, recipient validation, rate limiting, etc.&#x20;
* **Benefits**: Users can tip each other and manage their smart account from within their communication application via bot slash commands, with guardrails preventing errant or malicious transactions.&#x20;

### DAO Treasury Management

Decentralized organizations use TACo to automate and safeguard Treasury/DAO operations and transactions.

* **Challenge**: DAO requires multisig functionality with programmable and governance-driven execution conditions, without requiring manual approvals at each vote or payroll event. &#x20;
* **Solution**: Conditional signing with execution conditions based on election/governance/proposal/council outcomes and higher-level 'constitutional' guardrails.
* **Benefits**: Automated and trust-minimized execution of approved transactions without manual coordination, signatory availability risk, or human error.&#x20;

### Trading Agents and DeFi Automation

Automated trading systems leverage TACo for safe and constrained trade execution.

* **Challenge**: Trading bots need to execute trades but require safeguards against exploits, hallucinations, and illicit behavior.&#x20;
* **Solution**: Conditions that validate trade parameters – slippage limits, approved tokens, maximum position sizes, etc.&#x20;
* **Example**: A trading agent can only execute transactions that have been signed to confirm the proposed trade:&#x20;
  * Is via approved DEXs.
  * Is within position size limits.
  * Meets minimum return thresholds.
  * Executes during specific time windows.

### Gaming and NFT Platforms

Gaming platforms use TACo for in-game transactions.

* **Challenge**: Players need transaction signing without exposing their primary wallets.
* **Solution**: Game-specific conditions that limit signing to valid game actions.
* **Example**: A gaming application can only execute transactions that have been signed to confirm the proposed action falls into one of these categories:
  * Transfer of game assets between validated players.
  * Remains within daily transaction limits.
  * Target/utilizes verified game contracts.
