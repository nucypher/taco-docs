# Logical Conditions

Logical conditions enable developers to construct powerful, flexible access control policies by combining multiple conditions into structured logic flows that can adapt to a wide range of scenarios. By composing conditions with logical operators and control structures, developers can define precise rules that govern who is granted access, under what conditions, and in what sequenceâ€”enabling dynamic, context-aware authorization decisions.
