# Mainnet Deployment

Following a successful prototyping/testing of the integration using TACo's [Testnet(s)](get-started-with-tac.md), we are ready to swith to TACo Mainnet and deploy our application to production. TACo Mainnet is the fully decentralized version of the TACo encrypt/decrypt API and network.&#x20;

## DKG Initialization&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to use TACo in production, developers must request [Mainnet Access](mainnet-taco-beta-program.md).
{% endhint %}

## Mainnet use of TACo post-DKG initialization&#x20;

There are no substantial changes in the code when one switches from using _testnet_ domain to _mainnet_ domain. However, when calling to the encryption or decryption functions, take into account the following:

* The RPC provider URL (Infura, Alchemy, etc) must be changed to from Polygon Amoy (testnet) to Polygon (mainnet) since the L2 of TACo's mainnet domain is the latter.
* The domain variable must be set to mainnet.
* The Ritual ID must be set to the ritual generated by you.

<pre class="language-typescript"><code class="lang-typescript">import { domains } from "@nucypher/taco"

// This should be a environment variable
const rpcProviderUrl = "https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
<strong>
</strong><strong>const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider(rpcProviderUrl);
</strong><strong>const domain = domains.MAINNET;
</strong><strong>const ritualId = 0 // Replace by the Ritual ID
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>// Encryption
</strong>const messageKit = await encrypt(
    provider,
    domain,
    message,
    hasPositiveBalance,
    ritualId,
    encryptorSigner,
);

// Decryption
const decrypted = decrypt(provider, domain, messageKit, conditionContext);
</code></pre>
