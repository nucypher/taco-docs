# Use Cases

### Community Tipping Bots

Community platforms use TACo's signing product to enable secure tipping transactions in messaging applications:

* **Challenge**: Bot needs to sign transactions but shouldn't have unrestricted access to funds
* **Solution**: Conditional signing that only allows transactions meeting specific criteria (amount limits, recipient validation, rate limiting)
* **Benefits**: Users can tip each other through a bot without trusting it with full wallet access

### Trading Agents and DeFi Automation

Automated trading systems leverage conditional signing for secure trade execution:

* **Challenge**: Trading bots need to execute trades but require safeguards against exploits
* **Solution**: Conditions that validate trade parameters (slippage limits, approved tokens, maximum position sizes)
* **Example**: A trading agent can only sign transactions that:
  * Trade on approved DEXs
  * Stay within position size limits
  * Meet minimum return thresholds
  * Execute during specific time windows

### DAO Treasury Management

Decentralized organizations use conditional signing for treasury operations:

* **Challenge**: Need multi-sig functionality with programmable conditions
* **Solution**: Conditional signing with conditions based on governance votes or proposal states
* **Benefits**: Automated execution of approved proposals without manual coordination

### Gaming and NFT Platforms

Gaming platforms use conditional signing for in-game transactions:

* **Challenge**: Players need transaction signing without exposing main wallets
* **Solution**: Game-specific conditions that limit signing to valid game actions
* **Example**: Sign only transactions that:
  * Transfer game assets between players
  * Stay within daily transaction limits
  * Target verified game contracts

### Cross-Chain Bridge Operations

Bridges use multisig signing for secure cross-chain transfers:

* **Challenge**: Need decentralized validation of bridge operations
* **Solution**: Multiple validators collectively sign bridge transactions
* **Benefits**: No single validator can compromise bridge security
