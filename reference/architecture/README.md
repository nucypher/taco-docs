# TACo Architecture Documentation

This section provides detailed information about the TACo protocol's architecture, components, and interactions. Use the links below to explore different aspects of the architecture.

## Core Documents

- [Protocol Architecture](./protocol-architecture.md) - Comprehensive overview of the TACo protocol layers and components
- [Protocol Flow](./protocol-flow.md) - Detailed explanation of the protocol operations and interactions
- [UML Use Case Diagram](./uml-usecase-diagram.md) - Visual representation of actors and use cases
- [Porter](./porter.md) - Details about the Porter service that connects applications to the TACo node network

## Architecture Overview

TACo's architecture consists of interconnected layers and components working together to provide secure, decentralized access control:

- **Application Integration Layer** - SDK and interfaces for developers building Web3 & Web2 Applications
- **Protocol Layer** - Core protocol services and infrastructure
- **Porter Service** - Protocol abstraction and gateway
- **Web3 Integration** - Connections to blockchain networks and other web3 infrastructure

See the [Protocol Architecture](./protocol-architecture.md) document for an in-depth exploration of these components.
