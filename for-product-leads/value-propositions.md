# Value Propositions

TACo provides APIs for application developers who require:

* end-to-end encrypted channels for their users to perform operations safely&#x20;
* programmable, composable logic and conditionality  &#x20;
* an alternative to centralized control and its associated trust burdens
* 100% open source software, running across a permissionless network, fully decentralized from day one&#x20;

### TACo is a programmable control plug-in that makes your Web3 app more secure, more private, and much more decentralized.&#x20;

**End-to-end encryption for everything**\
Built on the privacy-for-everyone principles of mainstream end-to-end encrypted messengers, but useful across a wider set of domains and use cases. Everything from live-streaming to connected vehicles, from secret recovery to decentralized AI compute, from journalist protection to reproductive health care, from automated signing workflows to decentralized attestations.

**Trust-minimization via threshold cryptography and a collusion-resistant node array**\
Key material management and condition verification are operationally distributed across a diverse array of machines/servers, run by economically independent individuals and commercial entities.&#x20;

**Powerful conditionality**\
Operations can be made contingent on the fulfillment of predefined [conditions](../for-developers/taco-sdk/references/conditions/), and those conditions attached to varying granularity – eg. for decryption, a single message, or an entire table, or a petabyte of video footage.&#x20;

**Flexible condition composability**\
Conditions of all types – NFT-holding, RPC, time-based, known keypairs – can be mixed-and-matched using logical operators and flexible prefix notation into virtually any desired combination. Conditions can also be flexibly surfaced at different stages of runtime.&#x20;

**Full control over access managers & network parameters**\
Developers have total and perpetual control over the cohort(s) of nodes which manage allowed application operations. Network parameters, such as the size or composition of the cohort, can be tuned directly by the developer, or packaged into user-facing optionality to accommodate diverse risk preferences.\
&#xNAN;_&#x4E;ote: more parameter tuning will be available in future versions of TACo._&#x20;

**Threshold's track record for uptime, reliability and competence**\
The Threshold network's multi-app model incentivizes all TACo nodes to simultaneously provision service to tBTC, and abide by its strict availability requirements. With over [$130m](https://dune.com/threshold/tbtc) in TVL protected by Threshold nodes, TACo 'piggybacks' on tBTC's uptime, reliability, technical competence, and security track record.&#x20;
