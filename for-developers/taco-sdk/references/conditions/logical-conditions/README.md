# Logical Conditions

Logical conditions enable developers to construct powerful, flexible policies by combining multiple conditions into structured logic flows that can adapt to a wide range of scenarios. By composing conditions with logical operators and control structures, developers can define precise rules that govern who is allowed, under what conditions, and in what sequenceâ€”enabling dynamic, context-aware authorization decisions.
